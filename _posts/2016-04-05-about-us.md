ABOUT US

2e Leatherworks products are handmade in Portales, New Mexico by Audra Brown.

When it comes to handbags, ponchos, and other fashion, out philosophy is centered on the idea that each and every product is one-of-a-kind. 

Repetition is not in my repertoire. 

Holsters designs are focused on usability and durability. 

Being a competitive shooter, long-time hunter, and all-around gun collector, every design is based on real experience and real weapons.
